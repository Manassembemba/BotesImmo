feat: Implement and enhance room reservation viewing; Refine planning page colors

This commit introduces the ability to view all reservations (current, future, and past) related to a specific apartment, directly accessible from the main "Appartements" listing. Additionally, it addresses several issues and improves the visual clarity of the planning calendar's status indicators.

- **feat(rooms): Add detailed reservation viewing for apartments**
    - Introduced a calendar icon button on the `Rooms.tsx` page table to open an apartment's reservation history.
    - Enhanced `EditRoomDialog.tsx` with a tabbed interface ("Détails" and "Réservations") to display various apartment-related information.
    - Created `RoomBookingsHistory.tsx` component to present a filtered list of bookings for a given room.
    - Configured `Rooms.tsx` to control the `EditRoomDialog`'s initial active tab, allowing direct access to reservation history.

- **fix(types): Resolve `RoomStatus` type inconsistency**
    - Corrected a conflicting `RoomStatus` type definition in `src/lib/roomUtils.ts` to ensure consistency with the authoritative definition in `useRooms.ts`.

- **fix(debugging): Improve error logging for mutations and rendering**
    - Added `console.error` logs to `onError` callbacks in `useRooms.ts` mutations (`useCreateRoom`, `useUpdateRoom`, `useUpdateRoomStatus`, `useDeleteRoom`) for better error visibility.
    - Integrated defensive checks and `console.error` logs within `RoomBookingsHistory.tsx` to pinpoint rendering issues related to booking data.

- **feat(planning): Simplify and clarify booking status color scheme**
    - Updated `src/pages/Planning.tsx` to use a simplified and more distinct color scheme for booking statuses, based on user feedback.
    - Modified `STATUS_COLORS` to replace gradient backgrounds with solid, clear colors for: 'À venir' (yellow), 'En cours' (blue), 'Terminées' (gray), 'Annulées' (black).
    - Disabled all visual patterns (`getStatusPattern`) to reduce visual confusion.
    - Adjusted `getEnhancedStatusColor` to correctly map original booking statuses to the new simplified categories and ensure proper high-contrast mode functionality.
    - Fixed an issue where the status badge in the `selectedBooking` details dialog and the legend at the top of the planning page incorrectly displayed gray colors for some statuses by ensuring `getEnhancedStatusColor` is used consistently.
